### ***Description***
#### I am building a Greek Mythology browser Trivia Game. The player will be asked a total of 10 questions and will earn points for correct answers. Each question will have four possible answers to choose from. There will only be one correct answer. I would like to render only one question with answers at a time. I will incorporate a "next" button that will take the user to the next question. The game will start at a welcome page and will have a "start  game" button. By clicking on it the player will be taken to a game page. There will also be a "play again" button at the end of the game, redirecting the user back to the welcome page. I would like to  have a score display at the top right corner of the page, and a total score display at the end of the game. I am using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to achieve this.

### ***How to get started***
#### The game starts by simply clicking the "Start Game" button.
