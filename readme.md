### ***Description***
#### Welcome to Greek Mythology Trivia! You will answer 10 qestions and you will have 60 seconds to do so. Each question has four possible answers. Please choose wisely, only one is correct. A message will display if your choice was correct or inccorect. You will be rewarded 5 points for each correct answer and you can see your score on the top of the page. In addition, if your answer is correct, an image of Nike, the Greek goddess of victory will emerge. If your answer is wrong, you will see the image of Hades, god of death and the underworld and his three-headed dog. Do not be afraid- he's not here to take you. If the countdown hits zero, you loose! But worry not, you can always try again! If you do not run out of time, you will see your final score right after the last question. You can also play again from there. Have fun and enjoy!
#### All of the above was achieved by HTML, CSS and Javascript and is deployed on Surge.
#### If you wish to save it to your local machine, simply click "fork" in the upper right corner, then "code" and copy the SHH key and paste it to your terminal (git clone SHH).
